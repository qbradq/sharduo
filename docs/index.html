        <h1>Trammel Time</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Trammel Time, an experimental Ultima Online server
          emulation project. The project is currently in an open alpha
          status. There is no guarantee that a server wipe will not take
          place before the start of the beta phase if the project gets
          that far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feedback is especially appreciated. Please join the
          <a href="https://discord.gg/frYdFjbs">Discord server</a> to join
          the community, report bugs and request future features.
        </p>

          download and run the <a href="https://www.classicuo.eu/">ClassicUO</a>
          launcher. Create a profile and configure it to connect to a server at

          They are technically allowed but not officially supported.
        </p>
        <h2>Discord Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a family-friendly, safe-for-work server.</li>
          <li>Racism, sexism, discrimination, threats, harassment and personal attacks are not tolerated.</li>
          <li>Do not advertise or complain about other Discord servers, Ultima Online shards, websites etc.</li>
          <li>No flaming, creating arguments, posting in ill-faith or for shock value.</li>
          <li>No discussion of inflammatory topics such as politics either global or local or religion in public channels.</li>
          <li>No profanity or obscenity please. Honest slips will not be held against anyone as we understand a lot of people use profanity on other Discord servers. However a clear pattern of NSFW language will result in action.</li>
          <li>Listen to staff, they have the final decision. If a member of staff thinks your behavior is unacceptable in a family-friendly, safe-for-work community - even if not explicitly covered by the rules - they will ask you to change the behavior. Failure to comply will result in action.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Game Server Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Please note that the service is in a testing phase. Many of these rules will completely reverse if a production release happens. <i>Such rules are in italics.</i></li>
          <li>All of the rules of the Discord community apply to all forms of public communication within the game.</li>
          <li>Do not exploit bugs in the game service. If found please report the bug in the ⁠bug-reports channel.</li>
          <li>Third-party programs such as Razor Enhanced are allowed as are any other clients. However only the ClassicUO client without plugins is officially supported. <b>Please</b> if you think to yourself, "gee this is tedious, I'd like a macro for it" report it as a bug in the ⁠bug-reports channel. Tedium is a design failure.</li>
          <li><i>No limit on accounts per person.</i></li>
          <li>No limit on accounts per household. Please note that suspensions and bans are IP-wide.</li>
          <li><i>Multi-boxing is allowed.</i></li>
          <li><i>Unattended resource gathering is allowed.</i></li>
          <li><b>Never</b> share your account with another person. Actions taken on your account can result in administrative action and we do not accept "it was someone else playing my character" as an excuse.</li>
          <li><i>Staff may create items, alter decor, place permanent objects, etc. in response to player requests.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Direction of the Shard</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This shard will never allow nonconsensual PvP.</li>
          <li>Consensual PvP through guild wars and PvP events are planned but are not the focus of development.</li>
          <li>Development will be focused initially on crafting followed by PvE mechanics and content.</li>
          <li>Game mechanics are being written from the ground up. The goal is to implement each feature in such a way that feels like the UO:R-era mechanics integrated with quality of life features added from latter eras or games.</li>
          <li>Trammel Time is implemented using open-source software available at https://github.com/qbradq/sharduo. Contributions and forks are welcome but please understand the implications of the AGPLv3 license. If you use the software to offer another service you will have to share all of your source code, even if you do not release a binary. This includes decorations, region definitions, spawns, signs, doors, new and unique items, monsters, equipment and all manor of creative content.</li>
          <li>Trammel Time will never be operated as a for-profit business.</li>
        </ul>
